My personal  website.

* Site is build with [middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) ruby static site generator to handle the content and to generally make html more extensible.
* The javascript title bar is handled with [riot.js](http://riotjs.com/) web components.
* The login is a little hack of an html particle engine called [proton.js](http://a-jie.github.io/Proton/).
* I made a template for sites like these that can be found here: [https://github.com/nick-templates/middleman_starter](https://github.com/nick-templates/middleman_starter)
