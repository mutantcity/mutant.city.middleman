This is the first post of my new tech blizzy.   I wanted to put up this site to start farting around with HTML5 and ES5 ES6 and beyond!

Additionally I hope  to  post issues I've run across and  how I dealt with them or solutions I discovered to hopefully save future viewers headaches.  

My next post will be a rundown on the tech behind this seemingly simple blog and some of the issues I ran across.  (Cough cough static site generator plus web components).


Lets move into the future together: technologically, intellectually, emotionally, intimately, but mostly hungrily.
