This is the first post of my new tech blag.   I wanted to put up this site to start farting around with webtech, HTML5 and ES5 ES6 and beyond!

Additionally I hope  to  post issues I've run across and  how I dealt with them or solutions I discovered to hopefully save future viewers headaches.

<s style="display: inline">My next post</s> In a future post will be a rundown on the tech behind this seemingly simple blog and some of the issues I ran across.  (Static site generator plus riotjs web components).


Lets move into the future together: technologically, intellectually, emotionally, intimately, but most of all hungrily.

(To do: Reduce the size of that high resolution taco image. The tacos don't load rapidly on mobile.)
