Hi I'm Nick Kiermaier.  This is my professional site.

My professional interests are intuitive elegant code and UI's, and the intersection between the arts and technology.

My personal interests are craft beer, running, cigars, basketball, delicious food, philosophy, guitar, biotechnology, biking/surfing/camping/hiking, and so much more.
